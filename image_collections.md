"Single Cell Processes"

![Different Single Cell Processes](images/sc_different_processes.webp)

a The limiting dilution method isolates individual cells, leveraging the statistical distribution of diluted cells. b Micromanipulation involves collecting single cells using microscope-guided capillary pipettes. c FACS isolates highly purified single cells by tagging cells with fluorescent marker proteins. d Laser capture microdissection (LCM) utilizes a laser system aided by a computer system to isolate cells from solid samples. e Microfluidic technology for single-cell isolation requires nanoliter-sized volumes. An example of in-house microdroplet-based microfluidics (e.g., Drop-Seq). f The CellSearch system enumerates CTCs from patient blood samples by using a magnet conjugated with CTC binding antibodies. g A schematic example of droplet-based library generation. Libraries for scRNA-seq are typically generated via cell lysis, reverse transcription into first-strand cDNA using uniquely barcoded beads, second-strand synthesis, and cDNA amplification
